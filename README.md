# BrightPath Academy: Predicting At-Risk Students Using Student Performance Data

## 📘 Project Overview

BrightPath Academy is a forward-thinking high school located in a diverse, urban setting. Committed to academic excellence and holistic development, the academy focuses not only on classroom achievements but also on extracurricular engagement and personal growth.

Despite these efforts, BrightPath faces significant challenges in identifying and supporting students who are at risk of academic failure. This project aims to leverage machine learning and statistical analysis to address these challenges using the **Student_performance_data** dataset.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

BrightPath Academy seeks to improve its ability to identify and support students at risk of academic underperformance. The school currently lacks timely insights and effective intervention strategies, which leads to:

- **Delayed Identification of At-Risk Students**: Struggling students may go unnoticed until it’s too late for effective support.
- **Lack of Targeted Support Strategies**: Educators need more personalized and data-driven tools to support student needs.
- **Unclear Impact of Extracurricular Activities**: Limited understanding of how non-academic participation influences academic performance.
- **Data Overload Without Actionable Insights**: While large volumes of data are collected, they are not effectively utilized to inform interventions.

Our project aims to solve these issues using predictive modeling and data visualization techniques.

## 🧪 Hypotheses

We propose the following hypotheses to guide our analysis:

### 📌 Academic Performance & Risk

- **H1**: Students with fewer weekly study hours and higher absence rates are more likely to belong to lower GradeClass categories (D or F).
- **H2**: Students receiving tutoring are more likely to achieve higher grades (GradeClass A or B).

### 📌 Parental Involvement

- **H3**: Higher levels of parental education and parental support are positively correlated with better academic performance.

### 📌 Extracurricular Engagement

- **H4**: Participation in extracurricular activities, especially music and sports, is associated with improved academic performance.
- **H5**: Volunteering is positively correlated with higher GPA and better GradeClass categorization.

### 📌 Demographics & Equity

- **H6**: There are significant differences in academic performance (GradeClass) across gender and ethnicity groups, potentially highlighting gaps in equitable support.

## 📊 Dataset Summary

The dataset includes demographic data, academic habits, parental involvement, extracurricular activity status, and GPA performance for each student. The primary target variable is `GradeClass`, which categorizes students into grades A–F based on GPA.

## 🔍 Objective

By analyzing student data, we aim to:
- Predict students at risk of underperformance.
- Identify key factors contributing to academic success or failure.
- Provide insights for targeted interventions and resource allocation.
- Enhance decision-making for educators and school administrators.
